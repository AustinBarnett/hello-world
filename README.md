# hello-world 

Hello all,

I am a 19 year old roofing contractor, assitant manager at GNC, and a full time student.
I am currently persuing a degree at Valencia and UCF in Computer Animation. 
My dream job would be an animator at either Lockheed Martin, Pixar, or anything Disney related.
I have a passion for drawing and I love collecting watches.

Thank you!
